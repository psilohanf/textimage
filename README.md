textimage
=========

Perl script to parameterize ImageMagick to create a picture with a quote and an author's name.

(c) by Christoph Kr√ºger christoph@krueger.name

This script will generate a gif-image containing a quote and it's author.

Dependency: you have to have ImageMagick installed (and Perl of course).

Known problems: If your quote or the author's name contain single quotes (') the script will fail.
